# Flappy Bird - Java Game Project 🎮

## Introduction

This is my third and final Java project (for now), which is a Flappy Bird game! 🚀 This was a side project and a learning experience where I explored game development for the first time in my life. As someone who enjoys coding, I wanted to step out of my usual projects and experiment with something fun, interactive and challenging.

This project helped me understand the fundamentals of game development, including game loops, physics (gravity), collision detection, event handling and rendering graphics using Java Swing. The project is not perfect but it reflects my dedication, passion and love for coding. 💻❤️

## Features 🕹️

💠 Simple yet engaging gameplay: The player controls the bird and avoids obstacles (pipes) to score points.

💠Gravity & physics-based movement: The bird falls due to gravity and jumps when the spacebar is pressed.

💠Obstacle generation: Pipes are generated dynamically with randomized gaps.

💠Collision detection: The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or falls off the screen.

💠Score tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score based on how many pipes they pass.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

💠Java (Core logic & OOP principles)

💠Swing & AWT (Graphics rendering & UI handling)

💠Timers (Game loop & pipe generation)

💠Event Handling (User input processing)

## Pros ✅

💠Great Learning Experience: This project strengthened my understanding of Java Swing, graphics programming, and game logic.

💠Simple & Clean Code: The project is well-structured, making it easy for others to understand.

💠Decent Performance: Runs smoothly with a 60 FPS game loop.

💠Modular Design: Separate classes for the bird and pipes, following good object-oriented practices.

💠Dynamic & Scalable: The pipe placement system allows for easy modifications and improvements.

## Cons ❌

💠Basic Graphics: The game currently uses simple images; animations and better visuals could enhance the experience.

💠Hardcoded Values: Some values (such as gravity, speed, and pipe spacing) are hardcoded instead of being adjustable via configuration.

💠No Sound Effects: Adding sound effects for jumps and collisions would improve the experience.

## Challenges Faced & Future Improvements 🔧

###Challenges

💠Implementing smooth movement physics while keeping the gameplay fun and challenging.

💠Making sure the pipes spawn correctly and do not overlap incorrectly.

💠Managing the game loop and timers efficiently for a smooth experience.

💠Handling collisions properly to ensure accurate game-over conditions.

## Future Improvements

💠Add a Restart Button: So players don’t have to restart the program manually.

💠Improve Graphics & Animations: Enhancing the look and feel of the game.

💠Introduce Sound Effects: Adding audio feedback for jumps, collisions, and scoring.

💠Optimize Collision Detection: Using a more precise hitbox for better accuracy.

💠Make Speed Adjustable: Adding difficulty levels by increasing the speed over time.

## How to Run 🚀

1. Clone this repository:

 *git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/FlappyBird-Java.git*

2. Open the project in an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Netbeans or VS Code).

3. Ensure you have Java installed (JDK 8 or later recommended).

4. Run the App.java file to start the game.

5. Press the Spacebar to make the bird jump and avoid the pipes!

##Final Thoughts 💡

This project was a thrilling experience as I ventured into game development. It taught me problem-solving, graphics handling and game physics, which I never explored before. I hope this serves as a great reference for others looking to build their first Java game!

Feel free to fork, modify and improve the game. If you have suggestions or ideas, let me know! 😊
